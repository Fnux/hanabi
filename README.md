# Hanabi

Hanabi is a (work in progress) IRC server designed to build bridges between
services. See [RFC1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459#section-4.2) for
the IRC specification.

Parts of the code (especially IRC-related) were inspired by 
[radar/elixir-irc](https://github.com/radar/elixir-irc).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `hanabi` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
